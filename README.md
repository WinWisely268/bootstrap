# bootstrap

This sets up your laptop to develop the Web, Desktop and Mobile and Server code.

First run the bootstrap for your OS.

Then try the examples. Currently they use make files which work on Mac / linux, but also windows.
But on Windows the directory commands seem to fail.

It intalls golang and flutter but also some of the other bits we use.

You will need hover in order to run on flutter on desktop. See the Makefile.

# Windows

See the win folder

# Mac

See the mac folder
