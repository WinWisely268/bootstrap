# sync

Sync is a tool to help you to keep your local dev environment settings backed up.


## Use Cases

1. storing your ssh keys somewhere

2. Your bash, zsh development machine settings

## Logic

You tell it the local folder (s) to keep in sync. For example your $HOME/.ssh

It will then sync the files with a git repo somewhere.
